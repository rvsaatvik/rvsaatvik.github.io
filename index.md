Hello.

I'm Saatvik. Trying to build cool data stuff. I consider myself a plumber of Data Science/BI/Machine Learning.

I enjoy working on anything data, following a lot of sports, running and gaming.

Currently, building solving Data Engineering problems at [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/)

This is my first shot at writing, mostly scribbling some thoughts around aforementioned topics.
